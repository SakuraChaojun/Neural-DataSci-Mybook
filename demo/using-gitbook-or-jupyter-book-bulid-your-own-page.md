# Using Gitbook or Jupyter book bulid your own page

Using gitbook or juypter book is a good way to present your work to others, and it doesn’t have to be complicated to do so. So, in this demo, I will still use ‘step by step’ methods to tell you how to build your own page by using Gitbook or jupter book. Before you do this, you need to know some basic git knowledge because both Gitbook and jupter book based on git.

You can use DataCamp to learn more about Git like  '[Introduction to Git](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git)' 
{% endhint %}

## What is Gitbook

In my opinion, [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) is a modern document sharing platform that allows multiple users to collaborate to create, modified , and shared documents. like our textbook use ‘jupyter Books’ \(I will mention later, if you want to use jupyter Books only please skip to section two\) but this one is more user-friendly, and you don’t need spend much time on set up.

### From create an account to your first page

Based on the platform management requirements, first of all you need an [account](https://app.gitbook.com/join?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=header&utm_content=signup), this step is not difficult, I suggest you choose ‘sign in with’ Github. so that it is easy to access your page in later.

After that, you can enter dashboard page, like picture shows

![Dashboard Page](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

We can click the ‘Edits’ button to go back to the home page, then we click ‘New’ to select a ‘new page’. The default name of the new page is ‘untitled’ and we can easily change this information in later.

In this new page we can select the page template, for demo purposes we select the ‘basic guide’ template. Note that you can also import word, Markdown, and HTML files directly here but unfortunately ipynb files are not supported. This is also a major drawback of Gitbook in my opinion.

Gitbook not support .ipynb fies 
{% endhint %}

After planning the content, we first select how many Heading are needed and then add it. We click the **‘ ^ ’** button to edit heading and paragraph.

![edit heading and paragraph](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

After finishing the Heading planning, we can click the ' + ' in the blank to add the specific content. In common use, we can select Code block, image or Math to insert mathematical equations.\( For details, you can see my last[ demo](https://sakurachaojun.gitbook.io/psyo3505/demo/latex)\)
