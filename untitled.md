# Writing Math Equations in Jupyter

## Getting Super Powers

Jupyiter allows you to write code, text, mathematical formula and pictures in the same document and others can easily understand your ideas and processes by share this document. You may not familiar how to insert math equations in notebook. So, in this demo, I am going to show how to write formula in Jupiter notebook.

First of all, we need change the cell type to markdown. Because latex is not a programming language. Once the changes are completed, we can try to enter the first formula. Y=a+bx by typing

```bash
$ y = a + b x $
```

 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
